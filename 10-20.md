HW3 due after the midterm

- Do Sample midterms
- Answer "why" questions
- Make a one-page cheatsheet

## Learning

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- Explain the role of Virtual Memory in modern systems
- Articulate the steps involved in accessing an address by a
  system
- Recognize when memory/VM may impact program
  performance

## Virtual Memory

- It’s just another level in the cache/memory hierarchy
- Virtual memory is the name of the technique that allows us to view main memory as a cache of a larger memory space (on disk).

## Problems existing

• What happens if another program in the processor uses the
same addresses that yours does?

• What happens if your program uses addresses that don’t exist
in the machine?

• What happens to “holes” in the address space your program
uses?

• Can someone else’s program touch your data (or vice versa)?

## What is Virtual Memory

Virtual Memory is just a mapping function from virtual memory addresses to
physical memory locations, which allows cacheing of virtual
pages in physical memory. Required because main memory is
fully associative.

```
A.Virtual Addresses
 Pros:
    - Need PID
    - No need to translations

B.Physical Addresses
Pros
    - Expansive to translate
    - Need
    - No need to handle PID

Memory is in physical addrress, the actual translation
keep L1 Address in virtual addresses

```
A.Virtual Addresses
B.Physical Addresses
```

**all page mappings are in the page table, so hit/miss is determined solely by the valid bit
(i.e., no tag)**

> Suppose you have 8 KB pages, a 64 bit byte address, and 512MB of RAM. How many bits are translated (from your virtual page number to your physical page number)?

```
Virtual Page #: 51
Physical Page #: 29

64 bits virtual address, the toppest size is 64 bits
8 KB = 2^13 Pages, page offset is 13
64-13 = 51 virtual page number

512 MB size of ram tells us 2^9 MB , qhich equals to 2^19 pages,
29 - 13 = 16

mov (%eax), %eax

Cache Misses:
```

## A cache for address translations: translation lookaside buffer (TLB)

> Let's assume the value you want is currently on disk and is not yet in memory.
> Your processor requests the address. What happens next? TLB Misss

```
TLB Miss
TLB Exception
Call OS
TLB Fill
TLB Hit
Page Fault
L1 Cache Miss
L2 Cache miss
L3 Cache miss
Memory guaranteed to be hit
L3 Fill,
L2 Fill
L1 Fill
```

```
There is no physical address!!! Since there is not yet in memory,
So it's a page fault
```

## Effective memory access time(EMAT) :

TLB is used to reduce effective memory access time as it is a high speed associative cache.

```
EMAT = h*(c+m) + (1-h)*(c+2m)
where, h = hit ratio of TLB
m = Memory access time
c = TLB access time
```

> Let's assume the value you want is currently on disk and the page is now in
> memory. The OS has updated the TLB with the new, valid entry. Your processor
> requests the address and you have a TLB hit. What happens after the TLB Hit?

```
What happened next?
L1 Cache Miss
L2 Cache miss
L3 Cache miss
Memory guaranteed to be hit
L3 Fill,
L2 Fill
L1 Fill
```

```
TLB Miss
TLB Exception
Call OS
TLB Fill
TLB Hit
Page Fault
L1 Cache Miss
L2 Cache miss
L3 Cache miss
Memory guaranteed to be hit
L3 Fill,
L2 Fill
L1 Fill
```

### Let's walkthrough the FIRST access to an address

Let's assume the value you want is currently on disk and is not yet in memory.
Your processor requests the address. What happens?

That was painful....

- Misses to disk will kill performance.

  - It's so expensive, your OS will almost certainly try to schedule in another program to run in the meantime

- How do you know if this is happening? Your hard drive
  light is flashing.

## Let's walkthrough the COMMON access to an address

Let's assume the value you want is currently on disk, the page table
entry is valid, and the block is in your L1 cache. What happens?
