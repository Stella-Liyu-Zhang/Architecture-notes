## Amdahl’s Corollaries

Make the common case fast (i.e., x should be large)!

- Common == “most time consuming” not necessarily “most frequent”
- The uncommon case is usually not as important.
- Be sure of what the common case is
  - Measure it!
  - Your intuition is probably wrong.
- The common case can change based on inputs, compiler options, etc.

Repeat...

- With optimization, the common becomes less common.
- An uncommon case will become the new common case.
- Now you have a new target for optimization.

## The CPU Performance Equation (PE)

### `ET = IC * CPI * CT`

- ET: Execution Time – the time required for execution (i.e.,
  latency)
- IC: Instruction count – the number of instructions executed
- CPI: Average cycles per instruction
- CT: Cycle time (in seconds) – the inverse of clock frequency
  - 1 second / 1\*10^9 cycles

> Basic ET example: compute ET

- A loop with 10 instructions
- Executes 10^8 times
- Each loop iteration takes 12
  cycles, on average.
- 2GHz clock

What is the execution time?

- A 0.6s
- B 2.4\*10^18s
- C 2.4s
- D 4.2s
- E 6.0s

```
ET = IC * CPI * CT
    =   10*10^8 *
        12/10 *
        1/(2*10^9) = 1.2*1/2 = 0.6s
```

> IC equals the times of execution times how many instructions are there in a loop. so 10\*10^8 = 10^9

## Implications of the CPU PE

Intuition: ET in(de)creases linearly with

- IC
- CPI
- CT

Roadmap

- We can improve performance by improving each term.
- Benefits will compound.
- Trade-offs between each term are 1-for-1.

## “Dynamic” vs. “Static” Instruction Count

- The instruction count in the performance equation is “dynamic” instruction count
- “Dynamic”

  - Having to do with the execution of the program or counted at run time
  - ex: When I ran that program it executed 1 million dynamic instructions.

- “Static”
  - Fixed at compile time or referring to the program as it was compiled
  - e.g.: The compiled

## Improving CPI

CPI is the most complex term in the PE, since many
things affect it

- The compiler
- Program inputs
- The processor’s design
- The memory system
- The processor’s instruction set.

The majority of what you learn in this class and lab about improving software performance will be about improving CPI.

## Instruction Mix and CPI

- Different instructions require different amounts of
  work
- Instructions that do more work generally increase CPI

## Instruction Mix Affects CPI

Program

- Floating-point-intensive programs have larger CPIs
- Memory-intensive programs have larger CPIs

Program inputs

- Different inputs will exercise different parts of the program.

Compiler

- Compiler can choose which instructions to use
  - x\*16 (3-4 cycles)
  - x << 4 (1 cycle)

> Who can impact cycle time?
> Hardware Designers and ISA Designers

Three things impact CT

### Processor design

- The processor architecture and microarchitecture determine the minimum
  cycle time for processor design.
- It is the maximum delay along the critical path in the CPU.

### Manufacturing variation

- The CT of a processor depends on the characteristics of transistors on that
  die.
- Bad (or good) luck and increase (or decrease) CT
- Manufacturers “bin” CPUs according to their CT and sell them at different
  prices

### Software policy

- Software can set the clock speed for a running CPU (e.g., in increments of
  100MHz)
- This allows them to trade off performance for power/energy consumption.

## Processor Power and Energy Consumption

Energy and power are a critical constraints in modern processors.

- They have had a larger impact on processor design over the last 20 years than any other trend.

Energy (Joules)

- Energy is expensive
- Computers use a lot of energy
  - In 2017, data centers (i.e., “the cloud”) consume 3% of global electricity
- Battery life is a key cell phone selling point.

Power (Watts which is Joules/second)

- Power is a primarily a problem of heat.
- If your laptop or cell phone uses too much power, it will get too hot to touch (or will melt).
- Cooling cost rises with power consumption
  - Cooling is about 40% of data center energy

## The Processor Power Equation

P = V2FaC + Pidle

- V = processor core voltage
- F = processor frequency. Proportional to voltage.
- a = activity factor (the average fraction of transistors switching each
  cycle)
- C = total capacitance of the chip (wires + transistor
  gates). Proportional to area.
- Pidle = power the processor consumes when it is doing “nothing”
  - “leakage” because transistors are not perfect switches

## Program Energy

Energy = Power x Time

- ET \* (V2FaC + Pidle) = Program Energy
- We can computer ET with the performance equation

Battery life depends on power

- Battery life = (battery capacity in Joules)/(ET \* (V2FaC + Pidle))

## Interpreting the Power and Energy Equations

- Processor power increases with area (C) and switching factor (a)
- Pidle is roughly proportional to area of the chip that is powered.
- In practice V and F are linearly related (if the processor design doesn’t
  change) -- Higher voltage allows for higher frequency
  - So we can rewrite the equation as P ~ F3aC + Pidle.
    - Increasing frequency is very bad for power.
    - This is mainly why clock speeds stopped increasing.

## How Should We Compare Two Systems?

Most metrics don’t make sense without a workload

- “What is the latency of computer A?” isn’t answerable.
- “What is the latency of computer A running workload X?” is
  answerable
  But what should X be?
  > Challenge: Different users want different things
- Developers want gcc to be fast.
- Gamers want a high frame rate on Fortnite.
- Mobile users want good battery life for web browsing.

## Possible Performance Metrics

- Instead of latency, could we try to measure the
  “performance” of a machine
  - MIPS
  - MFLOPS

> MIPS = Millions of Instructions Per Second = Instruction Count
> Execution Time _ 106 = Clock rate
> CPI _ 106

## Benchmarks - Which Programs?

- peak throughput measures (simple programs)?
- synthetic benchmarks (whetstone, dhrystone,...)?
- Real applications
- SPEC (best of both worlds, but with problems of their
  own)
  - System Performance Evaluation Cooperative
  - Provides a common set of real applications along with strict guidelines
    for how to run them.
  - provides a relatively unbiased means to compare machines.

## In Return for Those Compromises We Get...

- Easy-to-run, carefully-
  configured benchmarks
- Some degree of
  impartiality
- Pretty good transparency
- Well-known
  characteristics
- We get some notion of
  performance over time

## Key Points

- Be careful how you specify “performance”
- Execution time = IC _ CPI _ CT
- Use real applications, if possible
- Use standards, if possible
- Make the common case fast
