```c
int name_me( int * arr, int length) {

int sum = 0;
int i = 0;
for ( ; i < length; ++i) {
sum += arr[i];

}
return sum;

}
```

## Registers are fast, memory is slow.

– This encourages us to access memory infrequently
– There have been ISAs designed to help encourage fewer
memory accesses

## Two types of ISAs: CISC and RISC

Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) - human readable language, under constant pressure to add features

- Varying amount of work per instruction
- Variable length instructions
- No limitations on how instructions interact with memory - Examples: x86, VAX

Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) – compiler output-able language, keep everything simple

- Fixed amount of work per instruction
- Fixed length instructions (each instruction takes, say, 32 bits)
- Forced behavior with memory
- Read from memory OR Write to memory OR perform operations between registers
  - Examples: Alpha, MIPS, SPARC, RISC-V

## Here are some suggested improvements to the store:

1. Whenever someone rents a movie, just keep it in the front office for a while in case
   someone else wants to rent it.
2. Watch the trends in movie watching and attempt to guess movies that will be rented
   soon – put those in the front office.
3. Whenever someone rents a movie in a series (Star Wars), grab the other movies in
   the series and put them in the front office.
4. Buy motorcycles to ride in the warehouse to get the movies faster

Extending the analogy to locality for caches, which pair of changes most closely matches
the analogous cache locality?
