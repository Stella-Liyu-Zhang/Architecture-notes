‘cse142’ is a command line tool you’ll use occasionally.

The most common is something like

- cse142 job run “echo hello world”
  What this does:
- Gathers up all the files in the directory
- Ships them to the bare metal machine in the cloud
- Runs your command
- Gathers up any files that changed.
- Ships them back to you.
  It looks mostly like “echo hello world” ran locally.

This is what cfiddle uses behind the scenes.
