# 64 bit pop_count

pop_count_8

```C++
unint count = 0;
while(t){
    if (t& 0x1){
        count ++
    }
    t = t >> 1
}
return count;
```

## 8 bit pop_count versus 64 bit pop_count

To pop_count 8,

```c++
    static uint8_t *ans = NULL
    if (ans == NULL){
        //new is allocated only once
        ans = new uint8_t[256];
        for(uint16_t i = 0; i < 256; i++){
            ans[i] = popcount8(i);
        }
    }
    return ans[t];
```

## How to make the 64 bit version faster?

```c++
    unit count = 0;
    while(t){
        count += popcount8(t & 0xff);
        t = t >> 8;
    }
    return count;
```

```c++
std::binary_search

```

O(f(n)), where n is the number of bits

## Better than O(1)

Hashmap implementation is O(1), binary search is O(log n)

```c++
sort the list of query
```

In C++, bool takes 8 bits

bitset: requires to pass in the size of the array statically

## Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort: The wost, n^2
- Insertion sort: For smaller arrays
- quick sort: mewww
- merge sort: the worst sorting algo, doesn't do bad with a larget data set
- std::sort(): After 125 size, does better than the others
