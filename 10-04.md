# Instruction Set Architectures and X86 Assembly

## The Stored-Program Computer

- Designs quickly converged on the stored program
  computer
  The computer comprises
- A central processing unit (CPU) that
  - Executes instructions
  - Holds a small number of values in a “register file”
- A memory that holds data and instructions.

## Instruction Set Architecture

- The interface between hardware and software is called the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
  - Different ISAs include x86, ARM, MIPS, SPARC, etc.
- An ISA defines:
  - Instruction formats
  - Instruction operations
  - Interaction with memory
- A compiler outputs code in a particular assembly format (determined by the ISA) to run on a machine implementing that ISA

## Operations vs. operand

- Operations are what an instruction does
- Operands specify what data is involved/impacted

## Key Operations Overview

- Arithmetic
- Loads
- Stores
- Branches
- Jumps

## Key Operands overview

• Registers
• Memory
• Immediate values
• Complex addressing modes

## Assembly Syntax

- There are two syntaxes for x86 assembly
- We will generally use the “gnu assembler (gas)
  syntax”, aka “AT&T syntax”. This different than “Intel Syntax”
- Be careful! Examples online may be of either syntax.

> ` <instruction> <src2> <src1/dst>`

## Arithmetic instructions

### Arithmetic operations:

- add, sub, inc, dec, neg, imul, idiv
- inc D means D + 1 -> D. Direct translation for ++D

### Bit shifts

- sal, shl, sar, shr

### Bitwise

- and, or, xor, not

## Registers

If it's 8 bits, you choose it to use 8 bits of the register.

```assembly
R[eax] = R[eax] - M[R[ebp] + 4]

A subl %eax, 0x4(%ebp)
B subl 0x4(%ebp), %eax
C subl %eax, 4, %ebp
D subl %ebp, 4, %eax

B
```

Since eax is the destination, we limit it to B and D, and we noticed that we are adding 0x4(%ebp) which implies + 4

```
Which of these instructions modifies the content
of memory?

A movl %eax, 0(%ebp)
B movl 0(%ebp), %eax
C add %eax, 0(%ebp)
D add 0(%ebp), %eax
E None of the above


A and C both works
```

C Reads and write from memory
D reads from memory
B reads from memory
A doesn't read from memory, only write to memory

memory is the destination

Since parantheses both represnet read and write to memory,
the context they are used should be the difference:

- ex. 1st oarameter: reading
- second parameter: writing

```
Suppose the following:
%rbx contains the address of X
%rax contains the address of Y

Assume X and Y are ints and you are running on a 64-bit system.
What is the equivalent to the C statement:
Y = X

A movq %rbx, 0(%rax)     Y = &X
B movq %rbx, %rax
C movq %rbx, %rax        R[rax] = &x
D movq 0(%rbx), %ecx     R[rax] = M[R[rax]] = x
movl %ecx, 0 (%rax)      mem[R[rbx]] = x  ---> y=x
E. None of the above

D

not allowed to derefrence both sides of parameters in instruction -- only accessing memory

- mov(%rbx), (%rax)

movl - 32 bits
movq - 64 bits
```

```
Suppose the following:
%rbx contains the address of X
%rax contains the address of Y

Assume Y is an int, X is an int*, and you are running on a 64-
bit system. What is the equivalent to the C statement:
Y = *X

A. movl %rbx, 0(%rax)      Y = &X, since Y is an int
B. movl 0(%rbx), %ecx      &X
movl %ecx, 0 (%rax)
C. movq 0(%rbx), %rcx      R[rcx] = X
movl 0(%rcx), %ecx         R[ecx] = *X
movl %ecx, 0(%rax)         M[&Y] = *X

D. movq 0(%rbx), %rcx
movq %rcx, 0 (%rax)
E. None of the above
